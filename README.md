# FAANG Stock News Sentiment Analysis 

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of news articles related to FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stocks. The goal is to understand the overall market sentiment surrounding these companies and its potential impact on stock prices. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, we aim to extract insights from textual data and identify trends and patterns in investor sentiment.

## Analysis Components
